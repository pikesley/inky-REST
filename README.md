## API

### `/paper`

#### `PATCH`

      ]
    }

where the values translate as:

* 0: white pixel
* 1: black pixel
* 2: red pixel

_Note: if your `matrix` is smaller than 212x104, it will be rendered from the top left corner and the remainder of the display will be padded with white pixels_

## Running it

    make install

then

    python webserver.py

ought to do it. You'll also need `foreman` to install the `systemd` startup scripts, probably

    gem install foreman

then

    make foreman

### nginx

If you want to stick nginx in front of it (and let's face it, if we've over-engineered things this far, we may as well go the distance) then install it, and drop something like this into `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`:

    upstream inky {
      server 127.0.0.1:5000;
    }

    server {
      listen 80;
      server_name inky inky.example.com;

      access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
      error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log info;

      location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://inky;
      }
    }
